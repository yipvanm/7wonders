            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>There have been many amazing structures on the Earth since humans have been building them. However, these seven
              wonders have been classified in ancient Greece as extraordinary. The Ancient Wonders have been associated with Greek writer
              Antipater of Sidon, who is believed to have created this list based on what current sightseers revelled at. The number seven
              was considered a lucky number by the Greeks. 
              <br>(Walton, 2017)</p>
            <p>COLOSSUS OF RHODES: Bronze sculpture made by Rhodians depicting sun god Helios. Completed around 280 BC and tumbled down
              during earthquake in 340 BC, never rebuilt. Rhodes Island, Greece.
            <br>
              <br>GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA: The largest of three pyramids built as royal tombs between 2700 BC and 2500 BC covers 13 acres. 
              The pyramids are the only Ancient Wonder that have survived until today.  Giza, Egypt. 
            <br>
              <br>HANGING GARDENS OF BABYLON:  Theatre shaped terrace covered in gardens as high as 75 feet, built around 600 BC. No archaeological 
              record, therefore many believe the gardens were a widely believed fictional tale. Babil, Iraq (?)
            <br>
              <br>LIGHTHOUSE OF ALEXANDRIA: Helped guide ships in and out of harbour, finished in 270 BC. Destroyed during earthquakes up to

              <br>MAUSOLEUM AT HALICARNASSUS: Made of white marble for the king after his death in 353 BC. Consists of steps (bottom), pillars
              (middle), pyramid roof (top). Tomb was placed on roof. Largely destroyed in earthquake 13th century. Halicarnassus, Turkey.
            <br>
              <br>STATUE OF ZEUS AT OLYMPIA: 40 foot tall statue decorated with gold and ivory to praise Zeus, god of the sky. Statue removed during 
              Christian conversion, destroyed by fire in 462 AD. Olympia, Greece.
            <br>
              <br>TEMPLE OF ARTEMIS AT EPHESUS: Series of white marble temples and altars built for the goddess Artemis. Temples were destroyed and
